##UNSUPERVISED LEARNING IN R##


__Overview__
. Unsupervised learning
. Three major types of machine learning
. Execute one type of unsupervised learning using R

__Types of machine learning__

    1. Unsupervised learning
        - Finding structure in unlabeled data, which is data w/o a target, w/o labeled responses
        
    2. Supervised learning
        -  Making predictions based on labeled data, which is data w/ a target
        - Types of predictions includes 
              . Regression or predicting how much sth there is or could be.
              . Classification predicting what kind/class that sth is or could be.
              
    3. Reinforcement learning
        -  Computer learning from feedback by operating a real and synthetic environment

__Goals of Unsupervised learning__

    1. Finding homogenous subgroups within larger group
        - Clustering - the process of finding homogenous subgroups
                . ex1: People have features such as income, education attaiment, and gender 
                      --> one might find homogenous subgroups or groups for members have similar features
                      --> label group A, group B, ...
                . ex2: Market segmentation - grouping customers based on geopgraphic subgroup
                . ex3: Movies - grouping movie based on features/reviews of the movies 
                              --> find movies most like another mover
                              
    2. Finding patterns in the features of the data
        - Dimensionality reduction - the method to decrease the number of features to describe an observation
                                      while maintaining the maximum information content under the constraint
                                      of dimensionality
                                      
__Dimensionality Reduction__
    
    1. Finding patterns in the features of the data
    
    2. Allowing visualization of high dimensional data while maintaining much of the data variability
        --> This is done because visually representing and understanding data with more than 3 or 4 features
              can be difficult for both the producer and consumer of the visualization
              
    3. Pre-processing before supervised learning.

__Challenges and benefits__
    
    1. No single goal of analysis
        ex: find the pattern of the data
        
    2. Requires more creativity
    
    3. Much more unlabeled data available than cleanly labeled data
        -> more opportunity to supply unsupervised learning

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Identify clustering problems**

Which of the following are clustering problems?

1. Determining how many features it takes to describe most of the variability in data
2. Determining the natural groupings of houses for sale based on size, number of bedrooms, etc.
3. Visualizing 13 dimensional data (data with 13 features)
4. Determining if there are common patterns in the demographics of people at a commerce site
5. Predicting if someone will click on a web advertisement

          ---> 2 and 4
               (1 is not a clustering problems because it is dimensionality reduction)

## Introduction to k-mean clustering ##
_______________________________________

__k-means clustering algorithm__

    - An algorithm to find homogenous subgroups within a population.
    - Works by first assuming the number of subgroups clustering in the data and then assigning each
        observation to one of the subgroups
        (ie, breaks observations into pre-defined number of clusters)
        
__k-means in R__

      # k-means algorithm with 5 centers, run 20 times
      
          kmeans(x, centers = 5, nstart = 20)
          
              . x : the data
                  - one observation per row, one feature per column
              . centers : the number of pre-determined groups/clusters
              . nstart :  the number of time k-means will be repeated
                  - k-means has a random component, thus a single run of k-means may not find the optimal solution.
                    --> Therefore, k-means can be run multiple times to improve odds of the best model
                    --> best outcome will be selected.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**k-means clustering**

We have created some two-dimensional data and stored it in a variable called x in your workspace. 
The scatter plot on the right is a visual representation of the data.

In this exercise, your task is to create a k-means model of the x data using 3 clusters, 
then to look at the structure of the resulting model using the summary() function.

- Fit a k-means model to x using 3 centers and run the k-means algorithm 20 times. Store the result in km.out.
- Inspect the result with the summary() function.

**Results of kmeans()**

The kmeans() function produces several outputs. In the video, we discussed one output of modeling, 
the cluster membership.

In this exercise, you will access the cluster component directly. This is useful anytime you need the cluster
membership for each observation of the data used to build the clustering model. A future exercise will show 
an example of how this cluster membership might be used to help communicate the results of k-means modeling.

k-means models also have a print method to give a human friendly output of basic modeling results. 
This is available by using print() or simply typing the name of the model.

The k-means model you built in the last exercise, km.out, is still available in your workspace.

- Print a list of the cluster membership to the console.
- Use a print method to print out the km.out model.

**Visualizing and interpreting results of kmeans()**

One of the more intuitive ways to interpret the results of k-means models is by plotting the data as a scatter plot
and using color to label the samples' cluster membership. 

In this exercise, you will use the standard plot() function to accomplish this.

To create a scatter plot, you can pass data with two features (i.e. columns) to plot() with an extra argument col = km.out$cluster, which sets the color of each point in the scatter plot according to its cluster membership.

x and km.out are available in your workspace. Using the plot() function to create a scatter plot of data x:

- Color the dots on the scatterplot by setting the col argument to the cluster component in km.out.
- Title the plot "k-means with 3 clusters" using the main argument to plot().
- Ensure there are no axis labels by specifying "" for both the xlab and ylab arguments to plot()

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Scatter plot of x
plot(x, col = km.out$cluster, main = "k-means with 3 clusters", xlab = "", ylab = "")

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

______________________________________________
## How kmeans() works and practical matters ##
______________________________________________

__Ojectives__
. Explain how k-means algorithm is implemented visually
. Model selection: determine number of clusters



__How kmeans() works__

Example: 
        Examining a visualizing data with 2 features --> 2 subgroubs
        
        1. Randomly assign each to one of the two clusters
        2. Calculate the center of each of the two subgroups
            The center of each of the subgroups is the average position of all the points in that subgroup.
        3. Each point is assigned to the cluster of the nearest center
    --Complete 1 iteration of the k-means algorithm--
        1. New clustered center of each subgroup will be calculated.
            The new center of each subgroup will be the average position of all points in that subgroup
        2. Each point is assigned tot he cluster of the nearest center
    --Complete another iteration--
    
        Some point of change may happen after each iteration
        When no observation has changed assignment, the k-means algorithm stops

There're other stopping criteria, such as:
    . stopping after a number of iteration
    . the cluster center moves less than some distance
    

__Model selection__

. Because the k-means has the random component, it is run multiple times and the best solution is selected from
    multiple runs.
--> The k-means() algorithm needs the measurement of the model quality to determine the best outcome of multiple runs.
--> The best outcome is based on total within cluster sum of squares as that measurement.

. The k-means() run with the MINIMUM total within cluster sum of squares is considered the best model.

. Total within cluster sum of squares is calculated as:
    - for each cluster
        - for each for each observation in the cluster
            - calculate the squared distance from the observation to the cluster center
            - then, sum all of the square distances
        --> And that is the total within cluster sum of squares
        
. Running algorithm multiple times helps find the global minimum total within cluster sum of squares

. It is possible to find identical groupings and Total Within sum of squares but different cluster labels

__Determining the number of clusters__

. Trial and error is not the best approach
. k-means is a better approach to run in one or some number of clusters, recording the total within sum of squares (y)
    for each number of cluster (x) --< scree plot
          - Elbow in scree plot: the place for the total within sum of squares decreases with much lower with another
              cluster -- The elbow value is used to approximate the number of cluster
              
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Handling random algorithms**

In the video, you saw how kmeans() randomly initializes the centers of clusters. This random initialization can 
result in assigning observations to different cluster labels. Also, the random initialization can result in 
finding different local minima for the k-means algorithm. This exercise will demonstrate both results.

At the top of each plot, the measure of model quality—total within cluster sum of squares error—will be plotted.
Look for the model(s) with the lowest error to find models with the better model results.

Because kmeans() initializes observations to random clusters, it is important to set the random number generator 
seed for reproducibility.

The data, x, is still available in your workspace. Your task is to generate six kmeans() models on the data, 
plotting the results of each, in order to see the impact of random initializations on model results.

- Set the random number seed to 1 with set.seed().
- For each iteration of the for loop, run kmeans() on x. 
    Assume the number of clusters is 3 and number of starts (nstart) is 1.
- Visualize the cluster memberships using the col argument to plot(). 
    Observe how the measure of quality and cluster assignments vary among the six model runs.
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Set up 2 x 3 plotting grid
par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
 
# Set seed
set.seed(1)
 
for(i in 1:6) {
    # Run kmeans() on x with three clusters and one start
    km.out <- kmeans(x, centers = 3, nstart = 1)
    
    # Plot clusters
    plot(x, col = km.out$cluster, 
         main = km.out$tot.withinss, 
         xlab = "", ylab = "")
  }     

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Selecting number of clusters**

The k-means algorithm assumes the number of clusters as part of the input. If you know the number of clusters
in advance (e.g. due to certain business constraints) this makes setting the number of clusters easy. However, 
as you saw in the video, if you do not know the number of clusters and need to determine it, you will need to 
run the algorithm multiple times, each time with a different number of clusters. From this, you can observe 
how a measure of model quality changes with the number of clusters.

In this exercise, you will run kmeans() multiple times to see how model quality changes as the number of 
clusters changes. Plots displaying this information help to determine the number of clusters and are often
referred to as scree plots.

The ideal plot will have an elbow where the quality measure improves more slowly as the number of clusters increases. This indicates that the quality of the model is no longer improving substantially as the model complexity 
(i.e. number of clusters) increases. In other words, the elbow indicates the number of clusters inherent in the data.

The data, x, is still available in your workspace.

- Build 15 kmeans() models on x, each with a different number of clusters (ranging from 1 to 15). 
  Set nstart = 20 for all model runs and save the total within cluster sum of squares for each model to the 
  ith element of wss.
- Run the code provided to create a scree plot of the wss for all 15 models.
- Take a look at your scree plot. How many clusters are inherent in the data? 
  Set k equal to the number of clusters at the location of the elbow.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Initialize total within sum of squares error: wss
wss <- 0
 
# For 1 to 15 cluster centers
 for (i in 1:15) {
    km.out <- kmeans(x, centers = i, nstart = 20)
    # Save total within sum of squares to wss variable
    wss[i] <- km.out$tot.withins
  }
 
# Plot total within sum of squares vs. number of clusters
 plot(1:15, wss, type = "b", 
       xlab = "Number of Clusters", 
       ylab = "Within groups sum of squares")
 
# Set k equal to the number of clusters corresponding to the elbow location
 k <- 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction to Pokemon data ##
__________________________________

. 6 features:
    - Hitpoints
    - Attack
    - Defense
    - SpecialAttack
    - SpecialDefense
    - Speed
    
__Data Challenges__

    1. Determining which variable to use for clustering
        - Which features should be used for clustering
        - Sometimes try multiple subsets of features is an important step to find the pattern of the data
        
    2. Scaling the data
    
    3. Determining the number of clusters
          - In real world data, clean "elbow" in scree plot is rarely exist
          
    4. Visualizing the result for interpretation
    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Practical matters: working with real data**

Dealing with real data is often more challenging than dealing with synthetic data. 
Synthetic data helps with learning new concepts and techniques, but the next few exercises will deal with data 
that is closer to the type of real data you might find in your professional or academic pursuits.

The first challenge with the Pokemon data is that there is no pre-determined number of clusters. 
You will determine the appropriate number of clusters, keeping in mind that in real data the elbow in the scree plot
might be less of a sharp elbow than in synthetic data. 
Use your judgement on making the determination of the number of clusters.

The second part of this exercise includes plotting the outcomes of the clustering on two dimensions, or features, 
of the data. These features were chosen somewhat arbitrarily for this exercise. 
Think about how you would use plotting and clustering to communicate interesting groups of Pokemon to other people.

An additional note: this exercise utilizes the iter.max argument to kmeans(). As you've seen, kmeans() is an 
iterative algorithm, repeating over and over until some stopping criterion is reached. The default number of
iterations for kmeans() is 10, which is not enough for the algorithm to converge and reach its stopping criterion, 
so we'll set the number of iterations to 50 to overcome this issue. To see what happens when kmeans() does not
converge, try running the example with a lower number of iterations (e.g. 3). 
This is another example of what might happen when you encounter real data and use real cases.

The pokemon dataset, which contains observations of 800 Pokemon characters on 6 dimensions (i.e. features),
is available in your workspace.

- Using kmeans() with nstart = 20, determine the total within sum of square errors for different numbers of 
    clusters (between 1 and 15).
- Pick an appropriate number of clusters based on these results from the first instruction and assign that 
    number to k.
- Create a k-means model using k clusters and assign it to the km.out variable.
- Create a scatter plot of Defense vs. Speed, showing cluster membership for each observation.
